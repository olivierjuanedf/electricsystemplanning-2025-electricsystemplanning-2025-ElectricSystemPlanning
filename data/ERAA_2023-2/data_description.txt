N.B. Regarding hydro inflows data for Scandinavia, the data have been taken from ERAA2024 edition as it was missing
in the 2023.2 one. Given that there is no possible matching between the (historical) climatic years (CY) of 
ERAA2023.2 and the (climatic-simulation based) weather scenarios (WS) of ERAA2024, the average over WS has been
calculated and assigned to each CY of the data provided here
